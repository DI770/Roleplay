                <p>

                    Thats all fine and all, but maybe the the person that is reading all this dosn´t know what roleplaying is? <br>
                    'Hmm. Okay, good point' <br>
                    Well friend if I...<br>
                    'Sup sh´oty! Imma be yo trainer. Right now you be like POW. But when I´m done you be like Pilla-POW'<br>
                    EHEMM!<br>
                    'What?'<br>
                    <em>*Sigh*</em> <br>
                    Since you are going to lead this game mind that I teach this person the ropes?<br>
                    'Oh, fo sho.'<br>
                    Thank you.<br>
                    Introductions first then. The person that you saw here first, is Tina, from the Borderline game series. <br>
                    'Tiny Tina, BABY!' <br>
                    <em>Tina takes out a crumpet from behind her paper screen and starts to gnaw on it.</em><br>
                    And I am Peter, creator of these pages.<br>
                    Now, you might wonder what roleplaying is. And that is fair. After all there is several things that shares the word.<br>
                
                </p>

        </div>

        <div class="intro">
                    
                <p>
                    There is the adult situation of roleplaying.<br>
                    With crumpets coming out from her mouth as Tina says.<br> 
                    'Sp´izey.'<br>
                    <em>Looking dissaprovingly at Tina. </em><br>
                    Not with food in your mouth, please!<br>
                    'Oh, sorry ´bout that.'<br>
                    <em>Continues to eat on crumpets.</em><br>
                    Then we have LARP, Live Action Role Play. People who dress into a role, usually an medieval setting. But there is also settings with Vampire themes.<br>
                    Theses settings are usually out in a forest or in a building designated for that setting.<br>
                    But the one I like to interact with most and will talk most of, is the TTRPG, TableTop RolePlaying Game.<br>

                </p>

        </div>

        <div class="intro">
            
                <p>

                    'BUNKERS AND BUSTERS, BABY! Roll for initiative!'<br>
                    Whoa there, Tina. Not yet, but soon. Can you take out the sisters for me if you please?<br>
                    <em>Tina goes to a wall to pick up two dolls that looks like two white rabbits and returns with them.</em><br>
                    'This here's Mushy Snugglebites, and this is Felicia Sexopants.'<br>
                    Thank you Tina. <br>
                    <em>I take the dolls and put them into two empty chairs that is around the table.</em><br>
                    But to return to the topic of Roleplay. No matter in what setting you are in, it all boils down to one thing. Acting out a character.<br>
                    TTRPG is a setting where people sit around a table to act out a character. But to also say it in an another way, it is an storytelling with rules.<br>
                    The game is built on outcomes that is decided by a combination of in-game mechanics, dice and other stats.<br>
                    Usually between 3 to 7 people play together in these games. In this case, this is counting you, me, Mushy Snugglebites, and Felicia Sexopants.<br> 
                    This is not counting Tina here, the GM, Game Master.<br>
                    'That´s Bunker Master fur you, Busta.'<br>
                    <em>Smiles warmly at Tina</em><br>
                    Right, since we are going to play Bunkers and Busters. But lets make it easy for the new person so it knows general terms, okej?<br>
                    <em>Tine squints over the table at Peter.</em>
                    'Fine. But i´m havin chocolate chip cookies'<br>
                    <em>Tina rises up from her place at the table and walks to an another wall where a vending machine stands</em><br>
                    The Game Masters purpose is to be a rules lawyer and to put settings for its players.<br> 
                    GM has the power to control everything in the world it has created. The weather, the towns, anything you can think of. Except the player.<br>
                    A good GM lets the players make the story themselfs. <br>
                    'Wait a minute. These cookies weren't chocolate chip. Those...Are...Raisins. Whyyyyyy-hy-hyyyyy?!'<br> 
                    'Destroy all the food dispensers! Wipe the raisin abominations off the map! I just wanted chocolate chip cookies! Why do bad things happen to good people?'<br>
                    <em>Tina runs to the table and pulls out an assault rifle and starts shooting down all the vending machines in the room, while I look on with an, "Oh right" face</em><br>
                    Forgot that the vending she was walking to was filled with cookies with raisins. Oh well.<br>
                    There are som other things I could talk about when it comes to the TTRPG. But most of them are the minor things that changes from game to game<br>
                    Check the other links at the top. If you don´t want to read, then I atleast suggest you watch the videos. They are not long, I promise.<br>

                    <em>Tina comes back after her murder spree of vending machines</em><br>
                    'Ya done!?'<br>
                    We are done.<br>
                    'Daaaaymn, you taking your sweet as time. By the way. What did your facehole say bou´t you being the creator?'<br>
                    <em>I look at Tina and smile warmly</em><br>
                    Nothing special Tina. Please, tell me an awesome story.<br>
                    <em>Looks at Peter for a couple of seconds, then shrugs.</em><br>
                    'Okaj! Who´s ready to riggedy-roleplay!?'
