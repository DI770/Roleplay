                <h1>How do role-playing games in general help neurodiverse individuals on the Autism spectrum?</h1>
                <p>
                    Role-playing games have been found to be effective in helping improve a wide range of functioning for a variety of populations, including those on the Autism Spectrum. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For populations needing to learn and improve appropriate social skills, cooperative play, reading, writing, basic math, creative visualization, verbal understanding and expression, and coordinated group simple-to-complex problem solving, behavior self-regulation, self-confidence through self-efficacy, and resilience, the therapeutic application of tabletop role-playing gaming is an ideal modality for many inherent benefits. 
                    Adding our additional multidisciplinary methodologies to these modalities further enhances the benefits of these activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our "general observations of ASD/PDD [Autism Spectrum Disorder/Pervasive Developmental Disorder] populations, when participating in well-run TRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Games)... generally leads to reduction of stereotyped behaviors such as fixations, distractions, hand-flapping (stimming), isolation, lack of response/interaction to/with others & improvements in social interaction, cooperative play, communication, and self-confidence.‚Äù

                <h2>Has any scientific research been done on the efficacy of RPGs for ASD?</h2>
                <p>
                    The RPG Research archives list all known research on the effects of role-playing games. 
                    When the website archives went live in 2004 there were only about 50 research studies. 
                    By 2016 there were around 3,000 content items on the effects of RPGs. 
                    As of 2021 RPG Research founder's Hawke Robinson has an archive with over 10,000 content items! 
                    The challenge has been keeping up with this massive increase in studies, and there is now a dedicate research archivists team migrating all of the content to a new platform
