            <h2> How do role-playing games in general help neurodiverse individuals on the Autism spectrum? <hr> </h2>
                
                <p>
                    Role-playing games have been found to be effective in helping improve a wide range of functioning for a variety of populations, including those on the Autism Spectrum. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For populations needing to learn and improve appropriate social skills, cooperative play, reading, writing, basic math, creative visualization, verbal understanding and expression, and coordinated group simple-to-complex problem solving, behavior self-regulation, self-confidence through self-efficacy, and resilience, the therapeutic application of tabletop role-playing gaming is an ideal modality for many inherent benefits. <br>
                    Adding our additional multidisciplinary methodologies to these modalities further enhances the benefits of these activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our "general observations of ASD/PDD [Autism Spectrum Disorder/Pervasive Developmental Disorder] populations, when participating in well-run TRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Games)... generally leads to reduction of stereotyped behaviors such as fixations, distractions, hand-flapping (stimming), isolation, lack of response/interaction to/with others & improvements in social interaction, cooperative play, communication, and self-confidence.”
                </p>

            <h2> Has any scientific research been done on the efficacy of RPGs for ASD? <hr> </h2>
                <p>
                    The RPG Research archives list all known research on the effects of role-playing games. <br>
                    When the website archives went live in 2004 there were only about 50 research studies. <br>
                    By 2016 there were around 3,000 content items on the effects of RPGs. <br>
                    As of 2021 RPG Research founder's Hawke Robinson has an archive with over 10,000 content items! <br>
                    The challenge has been keeping up with this massive increase in studies, and there is now a dedicate research archivists team migrating all of the content to a new platform
                </p>

            <h2> Reasons why role playing is important for your child <hr> </h2>

                <p>
                    Has your child ever picked up your phone and pretended to be on a call with someone, or even picked up a remote control and drove it around pretending it was a car? <br>
                    Has it ever crossed your mind to wonder what goes through their little minds?
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The benefits of role playing among kids are fundamental in enhancing skills required for healthy development. <br>
                    It is no wonder child therapists use role play therapy to help children going through difficult situations and even to treat conditions such as autism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with being fun, using imagination in their play improves their creativity and promotes better performance in school and it also helps them develop a strong problem-solving approach in dealing with issues. <br>
                    This is because it allows them to take up characters that act out real life roles.
