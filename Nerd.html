            <a>

                <p>
                    Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. <br>
                    It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. <br>
                    It has been published by Wizards of the Coast since 1997. <br>
                    The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. <br>
                    D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, and also deeply influenced videogames, especially the Role-playing video game genre.

                <p>
                    D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. <br>
                    These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. <br>
                    A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. <br>
                    The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. <br>
                    Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. <br>
                    In the process, the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.

                <p>
                    The early success of D&D led to a proliferation of similar game systems. <br>
                    Despite the competition, D&D has remained the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic Dungeons & Dragons, and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. <br>
                    AD&D 2nd Edition was published in 1989. <br>
                    In 2000, a new system was released as D&D 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from AD&amp;D; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. <br>
                    These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License for use by other publishers. <br>
                    D&D 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of D&D, the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2004, D&D remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game, and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide. <br>
                    The year 2017 had "the most number of players in its historyâ€”12 million to 15 million in North America alone". <br>
                    D&D 5th edition sales "were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet". <br>
                    The game has been supplemented by many pre-made adventures, as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups. <br>
                    D&D is known beyond the game itself for other D&D-branded products, references in popular culture, and some of the controversies that have surrounded it, particularly a moral panic in the 1980s falsely linking it to Satanism and suicide. <br>
                    The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.
